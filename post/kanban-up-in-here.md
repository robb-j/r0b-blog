title: Kanbaning my life ... because why not

So yeah, I use a Kanban to organise ... like everything I do and yes I love it.
All those tasks that need to be done become little cards and they jump and bounce around as you get them done.
I want to tell the story of my process, thinking about how it got to where it is
and think the decisions I made along the way.
Thats what this post is.

**What I love about it:**

1. Its focussed â€“ new tasks stay in the inbox, so less unplanned work!
2. Its accountable â€“ I have a history of everything I've done
3. Its adaptable â€“ I'm constantly tweaking and improving it as I go

## TLDR

I track all my todos in a Kanban board, moving them from inbox through to review.
At the start of a week I pick tasks from Trello and write them down.
On the flip side I create a grid for each day of the week and checkbox each day's tasks as I go.

## Problem #1 â€“ I'm forgetful

So how did I get here?
The whole thing started out as a need for storing the things I need to do.
Naturally I'm terribly forgetful and that apparently gets quite annoying if you've asked me to do something.
Once I realised this, I figured it was time to solve it.

Around the same time I was learning about Kanban and agile software development.
So me being me I thought I could re-apply the same logic for my day-to-day tasks.
And yes it worked. It worked pretty well seen as I'm writing this.
So I started using a **inbox** â†’ **doing** â†’ **review** â†’ **done** process.

Tasks arrive in the **inbox**,
move to **doing** as work starts
and slide into **review** when finished.
Then I get a chance to review them with my boss and they know what I'm up to.
Finally they can be moved to **done** and eventually get archived.

## Feature creep #1 â€“ prioritisation

I'd previously stumbled onto Steven Covey's "Big Rocks".
The idea is you visualise your day as a bucket and the tasks you do are a mixture of pebbles and big rocks.
If you fill your bucket with small tasks (pebbles) first, you won't fit in the big rocks after.
If you fill your bucket with the big rocks first, the pebbles will fit in around.
So, set out the big tasks you want to get accomplished and get them done
then the small tasks fit around the side and don't get in the way.

So I adopted this and decided to prioritise my tasks at the start of every day.
I'd start a page of A4 with "Todo today" and put my 3 biggest tasks, chosen from my board.
Then I'd fill in small tasks under that.
I put nice check boxes next to the tasks too,
so I can satisfyingly tick them off afterwards.

This worked well for me, things were getting done, cards were getting moved, happy times.

<!-- So that didn't really solve problem #1, it was more of a sidetrack
but it's important to the whole story so I'll keep it in.
So I have this paper-based system to prioritise what I do on each day,
but where does it pull tasks from?
Now I needed something to pull those tasks from,
sure I had a rough idea in my head but, well problem #1 still exists. -->

## Feature creep #2 â€“ stand ups ... by myself

Next I learnt about agile stand ups, a short meeting to organise the upcoming work.
I wanted to do this, but was working independently at the time so I didn't really work.
Thats when I started doing a "This week".
On a Monday I'd pick out the tasks I wanted work on and write them down on one side of A4.
On the flip side I'd split the page into 6, one for each weekday and a crossed out spare.

This means I'm focussed for the week as well as each day in the week.
I have goals for the week, then pick my tasks for the day from them.
I'd essentially created a backlog so I added a new list to my board, in between **Inbox** and **Doing**.

## Refactors

- tagging
- "Long term"
- History mode
- "Icebox"

## Board structure

The structure of the board is important, it scaffolds the entire process so I based in on a generic development project board.
It started off as **Inbox** â†’ **Doing** â†’ **Done** â†’ **Review**.
Things that need to be done land in the inbox,
I moved them to Doing when working on them.
Then they were put in done when they were done.

### 1. ðŸ“¥ Ideas / Inbox

This is where it all gets started, every card should get created here.
