title: Kanbaning my life ... because why not

So yeah, I use a Kanban to organise ... like everything I do and yes I love it.
All my tasks become little cards and they jump and bounce around as they get done.
I want to tell the story of my process, thinking about how it got to where it is
and think about the decisions I made along the way.
Thats what this post is.

## TLDR:

I track all my todos in a Kanban board on [Trello](https://trello.com),
moving them from inbox through to review.
At the start of a week I pick tasks from Trello and write them down in my book.
On the flip side I create todos with checkboxes at the start of each day, organised in a grid.

**What I love about it:**

1. Focus â€“ new tasks stay in the inbox, meaning less unplanned work!
1. Organisation â€“ I know what's up in a glance and I can get on
1. Scope â€“ It has life-level, weekly and daily todos and they don't interfere
1. Accountability â€“ I have a history of everything I've done
1. Adaptability â€“ I'm constantly tweaking and improving it as I go

## The problem â€“ I'm forgetful

So how did I get here?
The whole thing started out as a need for storing the things I need to do.
Naturally I'm terribly forgetful and that apparently gets quite annoying if you've asked me to do something.
Once I realised this, I figured it was time to solve it.

Around the same time I was learning about Kanban and agile software development.
So I thought I could re-apply the same logic for my day-to-day tasks and todos.
And yes it worked. It worked pretty well seeing as I'm writing this.
So I started using a **inbox** â†’ **doing** â†’ **review** â†’ **done** process.

Tasks arrive in the **inbox**,
move to **doing** as work starts
and slide into **review** when finished.
Cards get reviewed with my boss so they know what I've been up to
and move to **done**.

I liked this, I had a single inbox for everything that needed to be done.
Emails or passing conversations were converted to cards in one place ready,
not forgotten about.
Its structured as well so spontaneous tasks didn't interrupt my current work
and could be scheduled later.
And finally it was fun and novel so I got into the hang of it.

## Feature creep #1 â€“ prioritisation

I'd previously stumbled onto Steven Covey's "Big Rocks".

> The idea is you visualise your day as a bucket and the tasks you do are a mixture of pebbles and big rocks.
> If you fill your bucket with small tasks (pebbles) first, you won't fit in the big rocks after.
> So, set out the big tasks (rocks) you want to get accomplished and get them done
> then the small tasks (pebbles) fit around the side and don't get in the way.

I decided to prioritise my tasks at the start of every day into big and small ones.
I'd start a page of A4 with "Todo today" and put my 3 biggest tasks, chosen from my board.
Then I'd fill in small tasks under that.
I put nice check boxes next to the tasks too,
so I can satisfyingly tick them off afterwards.

This worked well for me, things were getting done, cards were getting moved, happy times.

## Feature creep #2 â€“ stand ups ... by myself

Next I learnt about agile stand ups, a short meeting to organise upcoming work.
I wanted to do this, but was working independently so it didn't really work.
Thats when I added a "This week" ritual.
First thing on a Monday I'd pick out the tasks I wanted work on and write them down on one side of A4.
On the flip side I'd split the page into 6, one for each weekday and a crossed out the spare.
At the start of each day I could write in the todos for that day and check them when done.

Bringing it back to "Big rocks" I'd prioritise my 3 biggest tasks and separate them out,
so everything else was a stretch goal.

This means I'm focussed generally, for the week and each day in the week.
I have my general goals and tasks in the Trello board.
I have tasks for the week specified out.
The I have prioritised tasks for each day with satisfying check boxes.

I realised then that I'd essentially created a backlog
so I added that as a new section to my Kanban board, in between **Inbox** and **Doing**.

## Refactors, tweaks and changes

I've been using this system every day for about 2 years now.
It's been adapted and tweaked a lot, but the format is mostly the same.
I use tags to categorise work/personal tasks,
I added an icebox for tasks that didn't get done
and I keep completed tasks grouped by month.

## Board structure

The structure of the board is important, it scaffolds the entire process so I based in on a generic development project board.
It started off as **Inbox** â†’ **Doing** â†’ **Done** â†’ **Review**.
Things that need to be done land in the inbox,
I moved them to Doing when working on them.
Then they were put in done when they were done.

### 1. ðŸ“¥ Ideas / Inbox

This is where it all gets started, every card should get created here.
