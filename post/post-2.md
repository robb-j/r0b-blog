We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists.

Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Life finds a way. Did he just throw my cat out of the window? I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.

I was part of something special. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!

Must go faster. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?

Must go faster. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. Yes, Yes, without the oops! So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose.
