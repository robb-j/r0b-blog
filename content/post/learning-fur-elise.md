  Trying something different, I thought I'd document learning a few phrases FÃ¼r Elise on the Piano
---

I recently tooted that I was [learning FÃ¼r Elise](https://hyem.tech/@rob/112525251520946192) on the piano.
I've also been doing recordings and sharing them with my Mum, how cute!

I thought it was kind of interesting to hear the difference in progress,
this is probably only interesting to me.
But here it is.

I was also curious about how I could incorporate audio on my blog.

## First recording

{% audio 'https://media.r0b.io/audio/fur-elise/01.m4a', 'Recording number one' %}

- I'm clearly still learning the notes and finger work here
- I think I'd just been able to make it all the way through

## Second recording

{% audio 'https://media.r0b.io/audio/fur-elise/02.m4a', 'Recording number two' %}

- I'm getting more confident, but still missing a few notes
- I'm still struggling with the second phrase, so much stretching fingers!
- I added a little bit on the end playing with the bass notes

## Third recording

{% audio 'https://media.r0b.io/audio/fur-elise/03.m4a', 'Recording number one' %}

- This is where I'm at at time of writing
- I've started using the sustain pedal for the base bits
- Its all flowing a lot better
- I've also learnt I can plug my phone into my Piano's USB-C and get a perfect recording
- I can't believe I messed up that note ðŸ˜”

Well that's that, hope you found it interesting! ðŸ¤·
