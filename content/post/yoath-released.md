If you’ve got a YubiKey and you want to quickly get OATH codes from your macOS status bar it’s the app for you!
Check out Yoath on the [App Store](https://r0b.url.lol/yoath).

Oh and it’s [open source](https://github.com/robb-j/MiniYubiOath), because I wouldn’t trust an app that talks to my #YubiKey that wasn’t!
