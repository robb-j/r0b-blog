  Documenting a library I haven't even created, and probably won't.

I was posting on Mastodon about a documentation driven design process recently 
and thought I'd do a post to share the thing I was thinking about at the time.

## Web Standards

I've been thinking about server-side JavaScript a bit recently
and especially the move towards web-standards on the backend.
Deno came along with a really nice "serve" API which is literally just a function that takes a [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) Request 
and you tell it how to respond by returning a Response.

I really like this API for two reasons:

1. It's minimalistic, there is no "res" to mutate or "next" to call.
2. It's based on a feature-rich web standard, parse JSON, stream bytes, ready query strings. It's all there.

Generally, that got me thinking about other standards but also the promise of them.
Web standards don't come and go every night. 
They're well thougt out and don't really get deprecated.

## Background

At work I work on lots of small to medium Node.js projects often by myself and each project is somewhat similar 
but I've often tweaked something or tried out a new library.
I love that I can do this and get to explore lots of things. 
But, I have lots of similar but not the same code which does make it difficult to go back to projects.

This time I took some time to think about what my ideal common ground for a project would be
and how a common ground could help compose future projects together.
If I have added magic link auth to one project, how can I reuse that in another project, for instance.

## Documentation driven design

This all lead me to writting documentation for my ideal library through documentation-driven-design.
There might be a more formal name for it, I'm not sure.
The idea is to design a thing from the prrspective of someone first using it.

It really gets you to think about the APIs and contracts you're creating
and how there could be modules and how those modules could work together.
Then you also need to think about how you explain those concepts
which really gets you to think about what is important about those features and what isn't.

It is also really freeing to do documentation in this direction.
There is no burden of any code being written.
If you want to change an API to be cleaner or simpler, you can.
Straight away.
You don't have to worry about how that effects the inner code base or how tests will need to change.

You do still need to ground yourself and remember what is possible.
That's why I think it works best when you have a good idea of what you want to make 
and a rough of idea of how it will work internally.
I think if you went in completely blue sky, you would design something that it wasn't possible to actually make.

## Gruber

The thing I was thinking about was a hypothetical server-side JavaScript library. 
Funilly enough, there is some interesting documentation to look at.
Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/robb-j/gruber).

I'd love to know what you think on Mastodon.
