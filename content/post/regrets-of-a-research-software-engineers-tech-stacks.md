I feel very fortunate to be a Research Software Engineer. Mine is a bit of a unique position, for most of my projects I work alone and have complete control of the technical side of what gets built and how. I work in an HCI group, Open Lab, with academics from lots of other faculties. We work together to make public engagements, digital interventions, tech probes and lots in between. I get to work on lots of projects and most of them donâ€™t stick around very long. So, I get to experiment with new technologies quite a bit.

Iâ€™ve seen a lot of hubbub about different tech stacks and app architectures, mainly focussed on how much JavaScript gets shipped to the people that use the things we make. Iâ€™ve been on the SPA bandwagon for a while and am definitely [rethinking](https://blog.r0b.io/post/trying-to-make-a-vanilla-web-app/) some of those choices made and things Iâ€™ve shipped along the way at the moment. 

I wanted to share a couple of the tech stacks Iâ€™ve deployed, think about my web development journey and talk about some of the decisions Iâ€™ve made along the way.

[Make Place](https://www.r0b.io/projects/make-place/) â€” this was the first project I got my feet wet with client-side JavaScript. I had until this point been a PHP person and this was a PHP server-rendered app. The main map page of the app eventually got rewritten to be a smallish Vue.js frontend to try and make some cool interactions for visitors and people we wanted to survey. This made sense, you canâ€™t do maps on the server-side and cool interactions were made. There were troubles with routing, shock, as client-side rendering looses the default browser behaviour. A fair chunk of time was spent managing that routing instead of the browser and binding that with the map. 

[Iris Msg](https://irismsg.io/) â€” this was my next big project after Make Place and working on a team for this one we ended up using a Node.js backend, static website and a Cordova web app with native elements. This was initially a very messy project, hacked together in a week in Athens with some rather lofty goals. These technologies were chosen more out of necessity than proper planning. It was all awful (re-read "1 week"), this was my first time doing JavaScript on the server side and it got me a bit hooked. I remember so many `.then` chains, Iâ€™m so glad we have async/await now. The static site is still going strong today, unsurprisingly!

[What Futures](https://www.r0b.io/projects/what-futures/) â€” this was my first SPA, all in, all JavaScript. This was a Node.js backend and full Vue.js SPA front end. It was my first time separating my concerns and designing an API for both of the components to work together. If I couldnâ€™t say it was because Vue.js was hot and new and exciting, Iâ€™d say I chose it because of scalability. It was going to be a deployment to thousands of users and I didnâ€™t know much (read as "anything") about doing that so I chose something that was claiming to do that by virtue of shifting that computation onto the players of the game. In retrospect, I didnâ€™t think at all about whether the players could run that JavaScript themselves or whether they should. 

[Catalyst](https://www.r0b.io/projects/not-equal-catalyst/) â€” this was my first attempt at SSR with Vue and Node.js and it was a bit of a messy one. Looking back it was so complicated to hook it all up and rearchitect how I knew Vue to get it rendering on the server. It was also a bit of a complicated project taking Google Formsâ€™ responses, applying a template to create Trello cards then taking those cards and making them into a website (I still think was pretty cool). Thinking about it, it was better to have it server rendered but having a Node.js and separate Vue SSG massively over complicated things that should have been happening on the same server. I think this was when I first became aware of SPAs could be a bad idea. 

[Deconf](https://www.r0b.io/projects/deconf/) â€” this is my codename for various virtual conferences Iâ€™ve hosted the infrastructure for, now an external name because other people used it and it stuck, kind of. This is a Vue.js + Node.js special, now with TypeScript, some (not enough) testing and a storybook. After running the first conference, things were rebuilt as a pair of libraries (front and back-end) and these have been used in subsequent conferences ([MozFest](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/plaza), [PlanetRed](https://solferinoacademy.com/planetred-the-power-of-many/), [PDC](https://schedule.pdc2022.org/#/atrium)). Similar to WhatFutures, still riding the SPA wave and it was primarily chosen for scaleability. It was the choice of making a cool interactive experience and it felt like the safest choice to scale for a conference of a couple thousand concurrent visitors. Apart from that time the Redis overloaded on the opening keynote, or unnamed DDoS attacks ðŸ™„. 

## Some more thoughts

Iâ€™m not sure why Server-Side-Rendering with Node.js never clicked with me. I think I saw SPAs as easier to develop and with better tooling and never really explored it very much. Iâ€™ve still not found delightful IDE integration for templating like Handlebars or Nunjucks that spots errors like missing variables or bad expressions.

I donâ€™t currently know the best way to make the interactions Iâ€™ve made with SPAs, maybe I should look into Islands Architecture more? If they were to be designed with progressive enhancement, I donâ€™t know what the other levels of them would be or how they could build up to be what I really want the experience to be. 

## Rounding up

Deconf is my active project at the moment, Iâ€™m feeling the burden of all that javascript Iâ€™m shipping at the moment and Iâ€™m quite conscious of the accessibility of the conferences Iâ€™m making. Itâ€™s Vue 2 as well so itâ€™s extra not-as-good. I am planning a next version, to turn into more of a Conference-as-a-service type thing but Iâ€™m not sure how I can provide the same exciting features Iâ€™ve made with a more SSG or SSR approach. The design hasnâ€™t scaled very well too, the UI was originally made for a single 36-hour continuous conference and has been patched on for 2 years now. 

Iâ€™ve been seeing a lot of negative sentiment for SPAs recently which has got me down a bit knowing what Iâ€™ve made and the experiences Iâ€™ve put out there. But at the same time, I donâ€™t think I _could_ have done a lot of those things without them so I donâ€™t know really. Iâ€™m endeavouring to find a better way forwards. 

Wow that felt like a bit of a rollercoaster, thanks for getting this far! If you thought this was interesting or have a suggestion, [@ me on Mastodon](https://hyem.tech/@rob)!
